# SistelCom - Sistema de Gesti√≥n de Solicitudes de Telecomunicaciones

## Overview

SistelCom is a modern web application designed for managing telecommunications requests in Spanish. It's built with a full-stack architecture using React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend, with PostgreSQL as the database. The application focuses on streamlining the process of creating, tracking, and managing telecommunications requests for different operators.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt for password hashing
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based session storage

### Database Design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless provider
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Tables**: Users, solicitudes (requests), plantillas_correo (email templates), and historial_solicitudes (request history)
- **Enums**: Predefined values for operators, request states, expertise types, and coordination types

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication with automatic token refresh
- Role-based access control (admin/usuario)
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management with PostgreSQL storage

### Request Management
- Complete CRUD operations for telecommunications requests
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Pagination for large datasets
- Real-time status tracking
- File attachment support for official documents

### Dashboard & Analytics
- Real-time statistics and KPIs
- Visual charts and progress indicators
- Request status overview
- Performance metrics

### Email Template System
- Customizable email templates for different operators
- Dynamic field replacement
- Template management per user
- Integration with email sending

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in through JWT authentication
2. **Request Creation**: Users create requests through validated forms
3. **Data Persistence**: Requests are stored in PostgreSQL with full audit trail
4. **Status Management**: Request states are tracked through the workflow
5. **Reporting**: Dashboard aggregates data for real-time insights
6. **Email Integration**: Templates are used to generate and send emails
